# Programming Fundamentals

Programs that can each be written inside the main method or other static methods without having to use OOP concepts. Concepts' practice. 

## Description

Solution 1: Wrote a program to reverse the order of words in a sentence
Solution 2: Wrote a program to ask the user to enter a year and tell them if it's a leap year or not
Solution 3: Wrote a program that declared and initialized a counter to 0. I Ran a forever while loop and incremented counter by 1 with every iteration. I then broke the loop when counter was 5. Lastly, I continued the loop without printing the number when counter is 3. 
Solution 4: Write a program to initialize an array of 5 float numbers. Loop through the array using a for loop and print each number.
Solution 5: Wrote a program to ask the user for a decimal number, and printed the floor, ceil, round of that number. 
Solution 6: Wrote a program to ask the user for states they have visited in the US. I ignoreed case by converting their input to lower case and I ignored duplicate inputs. The program runs forever until the user types "done". When the user types "done", the program displays the unique list of states back to the user.
Solution 7: Wrote a program that asks user for 2 integers and printed the divison of the 2 integers. I then utilized exception hanfling. I handled an  ArithmeticException and printed its stacktrace. Additionally, I handled all other RuntimeException and print its message. Irrespective of whether an exception ocurred or not, I created a S.O.S to print a "Thank you" message. 
Solution 8: Wrote a program that counts the occurances of each word in a text file. I made it case-insensitive by coverting each word to lower case before counting. 

### Executing program

Solution 1: Question involved String concepts
Solution 2: Question involves logical operators and conditional statements
Solution 3: Question involves while loop, break and continue statements
Solution 4: Question involves array and for loops
Solution 5: Question involves java.lang.Math class
Solution 6: Used one of the collection framework classes
Solution 7: Reuqired knowledge of exception hanfdling
Solution 8: Involved text file reading, using String's .split() method, using HashMap to store the word to count mapping
